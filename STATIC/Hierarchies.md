# Adding Hierarchical Data

For understanding patterns, it's incredibly useful to be able to easily and quickly aggregate.

Suppose you're looking at texts you have classified at the level of their "county."

There are a lot of different ways you could store this information:

```
county
    |
    state
        |
        census region
    |
    urban, rural, or suburban
    |
    winner in 2012 presidential election
```
