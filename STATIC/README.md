# Introduction

## What is Bookworm?

Bookworm is a platform for interactively exploring massive collections of texts as data.

If you have a huge collection of texts, it provides a way to interpret them, make them explorable, and unlock them to a wide variety of uses even if you can't share them freely for copyright or other reasons.

For data visualizers and programmers, it makes it possible to create new ways of exploring text data that can be easily plugged into many interesting collections without having to reinvent the wheel of tokenization and complicated systems for indexing.

For researchers, it provides a concise but powerful API for creating complicated queries across textual metadata that can easily accessed in your statistical analysis framework of choice, whether you want to use a web framework or not.

And for everyday readers, it gives a set of new, useful, and compelling ways to explore digital libraries that get beyond the restrictive search engine to help you discover macro patterns and interesting individual texts.

Bookworm was initially developed at the Harvard Cultural Observatory, founded by Erez Lieberman Aiden and Jean-Baptiste Michel. The project is currently jointly steered by Erez Aiden from the Rice Cultural Observatory, and Ben Schmidt from Northeastern University.

Major early contributions were made by Martin Camacho, Billy Janitsch, Neva Cherniavsky, Erez Aiden, Ben Schmidt, Matt Nicklay, and JB Michel.

## Styleguide

I'm going to try to use `Bookworm` (capitalized) to refer to the project as a whole and the overall project, and `bookworm` (lowercase) as a way to describe individual installations.
