# The Bookworm API

The Bookworm API acts as an interchange format for requesting data about large collections of texts.

The orthodox implementation at the time of writing is [my BookwormAPI repository](github.com/bmschmidt/BookwormAPI), written in Python and connecting to scripts

One of the major advantages of the API, however, is that it can be implemented on top of other systems (in whole or in part); so that bookcounts queries can easily be run through Solr, for example.
